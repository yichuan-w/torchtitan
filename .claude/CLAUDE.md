# torchtitan, as used for this research

This line is not a contribution path: nothing here is submitted to
pytorch/torchtitan, so upstream's lint gates and PR conventions do not bind.
What does bind is below.

## One canonical branch

`yichuan-w/torchtitan`, branch `yichuan/qwen35-port-cotrain`, is the single
canonical line for this collaboration. Feature branches are cut from it and
merge back once they have run or carry a smoke test. Keeping a long-lived
personal mainline anywhere else puts one change under two SHAs, and then
neither copy is identifiably the one that ran.

Pushing to `origin` writes into someone else's repository and needs Zhifei's
approval, given in the conversation before staging.

## Keep the work inside experiments/

Changes belong under `torchtitan/experiments/rl/`. Core torchtitan is shared
with every other model and example in the tree, so an `if tmax:` branch in a
core file breaks llama3, qwen3, deepseek_v3 and the rest without saying so. When
a core change is genuinely needed, raise it rather than working around it
locally.

Shared harness code reaches the other examples too: `harness/sandbox/`,
`harness/agents/` and `rollout/` are used by swe_r2e as well. Check those
callsites before changing them.

## tmax: what must not be "improved"

`vanillux_loop.py` and `vanillux_prompts.py` are a byte-faithful port of the
scaffold the 9B was SFT'd under. Rewriting a prompt for clarity puts the policy
off-distribution and starves the solve rate. Leave them alone.

`rollout_reward/mean`, the number on stdout, is not the learning curve. With
`drop_zero_std=True` the trained batch is filtered to mixed-outcome groups, so
that number sits near 0.5 by construction. The learning signal is
`rollout_reward/avg_train_reward`.

Per-sandbox Daytona resources come from the data row. `TT_DAYTONA_CPU` and its
two siblings apply only to rows that declare nothing themselves, so measure the
mix before quoting any fleet number.

## Where the rest is

`experiments/rl/examples/tmax/README.md` covers what the system is and how a
rollout works. `tmax/runbook/RUNBOOK.md` is the from-zero reproduction guide,
and carries the environment variable reference.
