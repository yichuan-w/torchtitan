class RolloutGroupWorkBuffer(Configurable):
    """Run-ahead buffer of RolloutGroupWork shared by the data-input, rollout, and batcher loops.

    Each entry is a RolloutGroupWork moving WAITING -> INFLIGHT -> FINALIZED. An active-slot budget caps
    run-ahead at `max_active_rollout_groups` active slots. By default, the batcher
    takes the oldest-admitted FINALIZED group while skipping INFLIGHT stragglers.
    A configured sliding selection window limits each selection to the first
    few active admissions while still allowing the prefix to refill after every
    selected group.

    For details on the buffer's callers, check the diagram in the controller.py file.

    NOTE: a work slot is **NOT** released when marked as FINALIZED or taken by the batcher.
    Instead, it is only released on `release_active_groups` calls by the trainer
    or data filtering. This is done this way so that we can guarantee we never have more
    than `max_active_rollout_groups` in the entire pipeline (buffer+queue+training).
    Otherwise, we would produce born-stale examples.

    Entry lifecycle vs active slot:
        entry:        WAITING -> INFLIGHT -> FINALIZED -> removed by take_finalized()
        active slot:  charged by add_work() ............ freed by release_active_groups()

        # max_offpolicy_steps=1, num_groups_per_train_step=2 -> capacity=4
        await buffer.add_work(g0); await buffer.add_work(g1)   # 2/4 active
        await buffer.add_work(g2); await buffer.add_work(g3)   # 4/4 active (cap)
        g0 = await buffer.take_finalized()                     # g0 leaves the dict; still 4/4 active
        g1 = await buffer.take_finalized()                     # g1 leaves the dict; still 4/4 active
