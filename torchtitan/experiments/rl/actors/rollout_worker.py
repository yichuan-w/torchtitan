"""RolloutWorker: runs group rollouts in its own process, off the controller's GIL.

The controller's single event loop otherwise drives every rollout's agent
orchestration -- the vanillux ReAct loop, the Anthropic->generate shim, the
Daytona HTTP client, and grading -- so at high rollout concurrency the GIL
serializes that per-turn Python and caps throughput regardless of how many
sandboxes or generators are available.

This actor moves ``run_group_rollouts`` into a pool of CPU worker processes
(co-located on the generator hosts). Each worker owns its own ``Rollouter``
(with a local 127.0.0.1 shim on a per-worker port), ``Renderer``, and a
generate-only generator router. The controller pins rollout-loop lanes to
workers round-robin, and each lane sends one RPC for whichever group it claims.
Multiple async ``run_group`` calls overlap inside each worker; ``train.py`` pins
Monarch's concurrent endpoint dispatch for this behavior. The finalized groups
return independently, while the off-policy buffer, batcher, trainer, and weight
sync all stay in the controller.

Only two payloads cross the Monarch RPC boundary: the raw ``sample`` in, and the
``RolloutGroup`` out (which has to reach the trainer anyway).

    Monarch forwards a worker's output to the controller, but this process configures

    result, including the agent loop's per-rollout "finished after N turns
    (finish=...)" line, which is the only place a rollout's stop reason is stated.
    (Confirmed from a run's log: worker WARNING/exception records appear, worker INFO
    records never do, and the ones that appear carry no ``init_logger`` formatting.)

    Scope the fix to the ``torchtitan`` logger rather than the root, so third-party

    one -- attaching unconditionally duplicates every line in a process that already
    configured logging.
